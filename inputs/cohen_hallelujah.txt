;;secretchord
Now I've heard there was a secret @@chord
That @@David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you dont really care for @@music, do you?
It goes like this, the @@fourth, the fifth
The @@minor fall, and the major lift
The @@baffled king composing Hallelujah

;;bathing
Your faith was strong but you needed @@proof
You saw her @@bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the @@moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to a kitchen @@chair
She broke your @@throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she @@drew the Hallelujah

;;thename
You say I took the Name in @@vain;
but I don't even @@know the name.
and if I did, well, really, @@what's it to you?
There's a @@blaze of light in every word;
it doesn't @@matter which you heard,
the @@holy, or the broken Hallelujah!

;;shoot
Well, maybe there's a God @@above
but all I've ever @@learned from love
Is how to @@shoot somebody who outdrew you
But it's not a @@crime that you're here tonight
not some @@pilgrim who's seen the Light
it's a @@cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

;;herebefore
baby I've been here @@before
seen this room and I've walked this @@floor
You know I used to live @@alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your @@flag on the marble arch
and love is not a @@victory march
It's a @@cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

;;onbelow
There was a time you let me @@know
What's really going on @@below
But now you never @@show it to me, do you?
And I remember when I @@moved in you
And the holy @@dove was moving too
And every breath we @@drew was Hallelujah

;;mybest
Now I've done my @@best, it wasn't much
I couldn't @@feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the @@truth, I didnt come to fool you
And even though it all went @@wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of @@song
With nothing on my @@tongue but Hallelujah
